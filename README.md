# CZ3001 : Advanced Computer Architecture

## Learning Outcome
* To **design** pipeline data-path and cache for performance improvement
* To overcome the challenge of realizing and leveraging the **parallelism** of different kind to be used for performance improvements required at present, and in the future
* Data-path and memory design along with the exploitation of **parallelism** of at instruction level, data level and thread level to achieve high performance
* How to **reduce** the length of the programs and **reduce** the execution time

## Coursework Assignment
- modified the ``4-stage pipelined processor`` to include ``load word (lw)`` and ``store word(sw)`` instructions
- transformed it into a ``5 stage pipelined processor``
- analyzed the operation of 5 stage pipelined data path and 
- ``simulated`` the LW and sw instructions along with rtype and addi instructions
